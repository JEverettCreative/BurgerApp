## Technology
* MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap. 

## About
* Eat Da Burger! allows a user to make simple choices regarding "burgers" on the application that correlate to data on the backend in a MySQL database. Users can "order" a burger by typing it into the text field provided and clicking "Order." Doing so creates a corresponding data object in the underlying burgers database with a column of "devoured" that is defaulted to "false." The burger then is generated on the page with a DEVOUR button to the right. If the User clicks the Devour button, the burger's devoured attribute is shifted to true, and then it moves to the right side of the page.
